Dear Matthew,

It's that time of year for all the hustle and bustle, but it's also the time for reflecting on the year that has passed and goal setting for the one coming up!

                                                                                                                                           Personally, I start doing this around September-ish... It's when I start getting the itch that "next year will be better"... :-)

By the time we get to Thanksgiving, it's hitting me hard (I blame the fact that my birthday comes around then) and this year is no different.

                                                                                                                                             What did I do right? What am I most proud of? What would I go back and change? What can I do to make next year be better than the year before?

        There's one consistent thing on my list that I'm always thankful for, and that is the power of technology to have connected me with so many amazing people.

                                                                             I am thankful we're connected here and in social media - and I can't imagine my life without you now :)

I'd love to hear from you... How has your year been? What are you working on for next year? All the good stuff... :D

If you have time, I'd love for you to reply! I'll get it personally and I'll be responding during that loooonnnnggg road trip up to Dallas for the Cowboys vs. Redskins game on Thursday! (That was my birthday present from the Chef!)

                                                                                                                                             THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU... From the bottom of my heart for being one of my biggest supporters.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                Wishing you and your family a wonderful holiday!

                                                                                                                                                                                                              xoxo,
